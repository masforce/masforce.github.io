                    <h2>A Brief Introduction:</h2>
                    <p> I was born in the glorious year of nineteen-hundred and nintey-seven, on the brisk Fall day of the tenth of September.  I was an inquisitive child, and to my good fortune begotten to such parents who would encourage such behavior.  My early days I spent in the fine land of Texas, situated in the center of our good nation and blessed with the finest Mexican food ever to grace my Mother's dishware. Such times were undoubtedly of paramount importance to the state of my current mental well-being, and I look back on those days of the early twenty-first century with immeasurable fondness.<br></p>
                    <p>At the present, I enjoy a comfortable lifestyle in the great city of Fort Collins, Colorado. Having dedicated myself to my studies and the worthy pursuit of higher education, I spend a significant portion of my time at the respectable institution of Colorado State University, wherein I am enrolled as a pupil. It is my hope to pursue a future based upon the remarkable computing technologies of our modern age.  Furthermore, I aspire to traverse the globe in order to increase my understanding of the curious cultures found throughout its many divisions.<br></p>
                    <p>I cordially invite you, traverser of the web, to explore this site with unbrideled enthusiasm.</p>
